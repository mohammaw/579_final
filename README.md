# Old School RuneScape Quest Tracker

This project is a web-based tracker designed for managing quest completion in Old School RuneScape (OSRS). It offers a user-friendly interface that allows players to track, filter, and update their quest completion statuses directly through their browser. This tool is intended to help players manage their quest progress efficiently, providing them with a real-time, interactive method to oversee their adventures in OSRS.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter quests by various criteria including completion status, difficulty level, membership requirement, and quest points. This makes it easier to focus on quests that match specific criteria and planning their questing route accordingly.

- **Persistent Completion Tracking**: Quest completion statuses are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring that players' progress is preserved between sessions without needing to login or register.

- **Interactive Quest List**: The quest list is highly interactive, updating in real-time as users apply filters or update quest statuses. Players can click on any quest to toggle its completion status.

- **Progress Visualization**: A progress bar visually represents the percentage of quests completed, updating dynamically as quests are marked off. This offers players a quick overview of their progress.

- **External Quest Guides**: Each quest in the list includes a direct link to its comprehensive guide on the Old School RuneScape wiki, providing easy access to detailed instructions and tips.
