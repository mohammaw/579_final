# Old School RuneScape Quest Tracker

This project is a web-based tracker for managing quest completion in Old School RuneScape (OSRS). It provides a user-friendly interface for players to filter quests by various criteria such as completion status, difficulty level, membership requirement, and quest points. This tool aims to help players keep track of their progress in the game by allowing them to mark quests as completed and filter quests based on their specific needs.

## Features

- **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter quests by completion status (completed or not completed), difficulty level (Novice, Intermediate, Experienced, Master, Grandmaster), membership requirement (members only or free to play), and quest points (specific points or 5+ points).
- **Persistent Completion Tracking**: The application saves the user's quest completion status in the local storage of the browser, ensuring that progress is not lost between sessions.
- **Interactive Quest List**: The quest list updates in real-time based on the selected filters, and users can click on a quest to toggle its completion status.

## Usage

### Marking Quests as Completed
